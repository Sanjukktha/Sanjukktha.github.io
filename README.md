## Work Experience
**Summer Engineer Analyst @ Goldman Sachs (_June 2025 - August 2025_)**
- Developed and optimized an internal-facing recruitment dashboard using React, TypeScript, and MongoDB, streamlining workflows for 100+ recruiters in the Human Capital Management – Engg. division
- Integrated Spring Boot services for seamless data exchange, cutting API response time by 35% via async methods @Async and optimized MongoDB queries using $match, $project, and $unwind
- Leveraged Goldman Sachs’ UI toolkit to build modular components with responsive grids and theme tokens, boosting UI delivery by 25% and ensuring WCAG-compliant layouts
- Worked in Agile team with Jira and daily scrums to build reusable React components, type-safe interfaces and layout abstractions, reducing dev time by 30% and improving maintainability


**SWE Intern @ Saint-Gobain Research  (_January 2024 - July 2024_)**
- Built a web-based visualization platform for analyzing glass thickness, deformation, and stress metrics, architected with React.js and TypeScript to deliver interactive and scalable dashboarsds for material scientists
- Constructed back-end logic in Node.js, integrating Python scripts for complex computations across 20 glass use cases, while designing RESTful API endpoints with Express.js


**Machine Learning Intern @ TeleApps (_June 2023 - July 2023_)**
- Engineered two applications by converting TensorFlow machine learning models into reusable web services using Python and Flask, reducing model load times by 40%
- Optimized feature selection by identifying key predictors- customer behavior metrics and time-series data, and extracted new features using pandas that increased model accuracy by 15% in predicting user engagement
- Resolved overfitting in models, data inconsistencies in input datasets, and integration challenges between TensorFlow models and Flask API


## Projects
**Personal Finance Dashboard**

- Developed a full-stack Personal Finance Dashboard using React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB for real-time expense budgeting
- Optimized performance through lazy loading, responsive design, and service workers, resulting in a 40% reduction in load times and improved user experience

**Liver Disease Prediction**

- Performed comprehensive data analysis using bivariate and multivariate techniques to uncover dependencies
- Applied 3 feature selection methods—correlation, embedded, and filter methods—to refine the dataset and enhance model performance
- Implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting, and ANN, achieving a peak accuracy of 93.63% with the Random Forest algorithm by excluding the ‘gender’ feature

**Advanced Text Analysis for Fake News Detection**

- Employed cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance
- Utilized tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization to preprocess text data effectively
- Extracted word frequency, n-grams, and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) values from text data to represent articles numerically

## Certifications & Achievements
- Problem Winner of Hack-In-Hub 2023 Hackathon – Won first place in the Agriculture Domain of the 28-hour National Level Hackathon conducted by SSRIT, Chennai, by developing an IoT grain monitoring system with Arduino, DHT22 sensors, and a camera module for real-time humidity and color analysis, integrating Python for data processing and React Native for alert notifications, which optimized godown inventory management
